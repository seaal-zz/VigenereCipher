Instructions:

  When you are asked to make a choice, type and enter the number next to the choice that you desire.
  If you are asked to enter a message or key, type the information in full and enter it.
  Only letters are encrypted and decrypted. Symbols are allowed in messages (both encrypted and decrypted), but they will not be changed. However, symbols are not allowed in the key.
 
Important Info:

  Upper and lowercase letters have their cases preserved.
  If the key length does not match the length of the message, the key will loop until it does so as to encrypt the entire message.
